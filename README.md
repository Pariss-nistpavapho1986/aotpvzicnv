Whoa, ok, so Phule – where do I even start? Just walked out, and my brain's doing somersaults like a cat chasing a laser pointer in a kaleidoscope. I mean... what was that? The screen still kinda flickering in my mind, probs the most whack lightshow I've seen since that time we all got VR headsets and realized the floor was lava with actual lava sounds blasting through the speakers. 

So, there's this scene, right, where the protagonist — no, what's his name again? My God, why can't I remember simple names?? Anyway, when he’s facing down that three-headed villain-duck hybrid thing, that image is burned into my retinas like the last time I tried to fry an egg and ended up with a fire alarm chorus. And speaking of alarms, did you hear that one dude snoring behind us? Man must've been sawing logs the whole time! But whatever.

Popcorn everywhere — I swear I could feel the butter seeping through the cushions like it was plotting to synchronize with the climax. Honestly? Best special feature, zero cost. The ending though, what was even happening? Felt like a rollercoaster riding through molasses, kinda stuck yet moving all at once. Like watching cats trapped in a peanut butter jar fighting a pirate named Destiny.

> The dialogue was all over like spaghetti peppered with philosophical musings and existential dread, but weirdly they pulled it off, kinda like wearing mismatched socks and pretending you invented a trend. Remember when someone asked if you could download the movie instead of watching it in theaters? Save your brain the exercise, tell 'em it's an experience, man. 

Also, randomly, I’m pretty sure I felt my chair vibrating during the whole underwater car chase. Why underwater?? Cars shouldn’t be there — but hey, neither should I, after eating that entire jumbo popcorn. My back's protesting louder than the speakers, and my mind has packed its bags for Neverland.

Hey, the colors were like Skittles threw a party in a black hole — so vivid, yet just on the brink of existing. Anyway, I’d say watch the movie if you’re into being blindsided by a tsunami of 'what-the-heck' moments, though probably not with a hangover. Or three.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
void planEscape(int plan) {
    beFree = (int)random() % plan; 
    cout << Escape plan initialized.;
}
// note to self: fix this function later 
```
